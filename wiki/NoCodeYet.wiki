#summary The code will be available soon, we need legal approval for the first release

== Where's the code? ==

!WinDriver was initially developed as an internal project at eBay. To release the code written in this period, it needs to be reviewed by our Legal department to make sure it doesn't have company secrets in it. 

== When will it be released? ==

Soon! Early/mid January, barring unforeseen problems.

== Is this an ongoing problem? ==

No. Once the code has been released, future development will be done 'in the open'.
